The Framework supports various relational database through the use of plugins.

The database support has the following structure:

* Entity definitions for hosts, services, vulnerabilities, and notes
* Generic database API for manipulating entities
* Generic database command set for interacting with the backend
* Vendor-specific plugins for linking the API to a real database
* Generic plugins for database integration

[Entity Definitions]

	lib/msf/core/db_objects.rb
	data/sql/*.sql

[Generic API]
	lib/msf/core/db.rb
	lib/msf/core/db_manager.rb

[Generic Commands]
	lib/msf/ui/console/command_dispatcher/db.rb
	
[Specific Plugins]
	plugins/db_sqlite2.rb
	plugins/db_sqlite3.rb
	plugins/db_postgres.rb
	plugins/db_mysql.rb

[Extra Plugins]
	plugins/db_tracker.rb

To test the database support, install the appropriate Ruby support module,
start msfconsole, and load the vendor-specific plugin:

$ msfconsole

msf> load db_sqlite3
[*] Successfully loaded plugin: db_sqlite3

You can now use the "db" commands to interact with the database.
