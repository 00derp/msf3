		# The raw, unquoted base64 without the terminating equals works because
		# PHP treats it like a string.  There are, however, a couple of caveats
		# because first, PHP tries to parse the bare string as a constant.
		# Because of this, the string is limited to things that can be
		# identifiers, i.e., things that start with [a-zA-Z] and contain only
		# [a-zA-Z0-9_].  Also, for payloads that encode to more than 998
		# characters, only part of the payload gets unencoded on the victim,
		# presumably due to a limitation in php identifier names, so we break
		# the encoded payload into roughly 900-byte chunks. 
		b64 = Rex::Text.encode_base64(buf)

		# The '=' or '==' used for padding at the end of the base64 encoded
		# data is unnecessary and can cause parse errors when we use it as a
		# raw string, so strip it off.
