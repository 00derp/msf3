lmh & hdm:
	- IDE
		- wizard
			- describe ALL steps
			- describe the options to be available
			- flow chart extremely useful:
				graphviz. simple.
				(show every possible path/data set in wizard)
				my brain eats diagrams.

		- advanced editor
			- not yet started
			- options implemented as 'slide' panels
			- main text area shows code in real time
			- direct access to opcodes:
				- calculate hex values from pure asm
				- retrieve opcodes from db
					- ajax search
			- drag and drop functionality.

	- Exploits in msfweb
		- linear:
			select target
			select options
			select payload
			profit

	- Web Console
		- (LMH) Re-implement the text box and prompt, so that long lines and 
		  quickly-typed commands do not exhibit problems. The prompt
		  should be visible and not possible for the user to edity. The prompt
		  text should be based on a javascript variable which will be updated
		  bu AJAX calls.
		 
		- (LMH) Ajax data conversation. We need a javascript function that sends
    	  the latest command data and reads back a block of JS code. The block
		  of code returned should be evaluated and contain the following bits
		  of data:
		  
		  a) The current prompt text (which is then updated)
		  b) The output to add to the output listing
		 
		- (HD) Implement msfconsole commands as synchronous AJAX call, not the
		  slow async write to a buffer and the poll for updates.
		  
		- (HD) Implement the tab completion backend. This function will look
		  exactly like the one to send a command, except it will include a paramter
		  indicating that the tab results should be returned. The JS response
		  should include an array of the tab completion possibilities.
		
		- (LMH) Stub up a tab completion system that shows the possible options
		  and allows completion of the text field when only one result is left
		  matching.
