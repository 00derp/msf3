This goal of this project is to provide a consistent interface to LBL's libpcap
packet capture library. This project was created because the currently
available ruby-pcap library is poorly designed and has been unmaintained since
2000. This does not provide packet processing functionality, it simply provides
the interface for capturing packets. For packet processing capability, see the
PacketRub project (http://packetrub.rubyforge.org).

Requirements:
  libpcap - http://www.tcpdump.org

Build & Install:
  ruby extconf.rb && make && make install

The latest version can be obtained from Subversion:
  svn checkout http://pcaprub.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/

The Metasploit Project also provides a Subversion repository:
  svn checkout http://metasploit.com/svn/framework3/trunk/external/pcaprub/
